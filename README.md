# LoftyHeights
Lofty Heights is an apartment search website created in school. This was our first project to practice PHP and MySQL.
My ideas I applied to this project is the design and the recent login link built to it.
When I was creating the recent login link, I've used PHP cookies which I've learned from w3schools.com.
I viewed facebook to get an idea of how this website was created and was wondering how the recent login was made.
I figure it must be from the website's cookies, so I googled PHP cookies.
