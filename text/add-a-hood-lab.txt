Add-a-Hood CMS It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood! 
Continue working on the CMS, adding a third tab: HOOD. 
Follow the include-AJAX-PHP no-form style, as found in Add-a-Bldg and Add-an-Apt:

Make new fields to the neighborhoods table: borough and subway (ex: E, F)
Enhance the tabbed panel UI by adding a hood div and HOOD tab div. 
Clicking the HOOD tab calls the Javascript function that sets the z-index
Put the hood input elements and AJAX function in an include file
The Hood CMS has four inputs: hoodName., borough, subway and hoodDesc
Clicking the SAVE HOOD button calls the ajaxSaveHood function
AJAX sends GET vars as querystring to PHP processor
PHP inserts the new hood into the neighborhoods table of MySQL database
PHP echoes the new hood ID back to AJAX 
EXTRA CREDIT: 

Use the new hood ID, echoed back by PHP back to AJAX, to set the new hood the default choice in the the Bldg CMS. So if you add a hood and then click BLDG, the new hood is already the choice in the Neighborhoods menu.
